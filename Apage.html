                But do you always find yourself feeling like you’ve got so much on your plate before you leave that you’re never going to get through it all in time?
                And once you’ve got to your destination, does it just seem like you’re spending all your time recuperating rather than actually enjoying your vacation? 
                Should you be canceling that ticket to Bangkok, Santorini, or Barcelona? Are you thinking about putting off that trip to the countryside? Don’t! 
                Have faith in Tripito. Prepare for your break wisely—and well in advance—by following a few golden rules.
